        Making life easier with Rust: Pushing to GitHub via a single command
    </h1>
    I use git for almost all my code projects, including this website. And like almost all who use git, I also use github.
    And as I finish any work I choose to do on a given day, I find myself facing the task of adding, commiting and pushing my code into my 
    remote repository. Before we go on any further, I am indeed aware that these are just three simple
    commands on the terminal. A single line even, if one were to make judicious use of '&' to put all these commands together in the same line.
    <br>
    <br>
    But the problem with it lies in it's simplicity. Since we assume it is just a single line, we are not averse to typing it out again and again
     as we assume no time wil be wasted by it. And yet the time spent typing these out adds up. That is not to mention how mind-numbing it would be to 
     type out these commands over and over again for every change we make. What I am trying to get at is, these are the sort of tasks we ought to automate 
     as much as possible. 
     <br>
     <br>
     Having established that we will be writing a program to automate this simple, yet repetitive task, we need to decide which programming language we are going to use.
     I have chosen to write my program in Rust. I did this because at the time I was writing this I was interested in Rust and was learning the language on my own.
     So, this seemed like a fun little project for me to get a better grasp on the subject. I'll give a very brief introduction (in my terms) of Rust before we proceed to the actual code.
     At the end, we would have an executable binary which we can run on the command line with a single word to perform 
     the different tasks of adding, commiting and pushing.
     Feel free to skip that if you already know what Rust is.

     <h3>Rust</h3>
     According to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust-lang.org</a>, Rust is "A language empowering everyone
     to build reliable and efficient software." According to Wikipedia, Rust is "Rust is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose programming language designed
      for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency." None of these definitions made sense to me when I first started learning Rust. 
      <br><br> The trick to getting what Rust actually lies in the fact that it is a systems language. Now, I forget where I first saw this term but it is widely used and certainly not an obscure descriptor.
      Anyway, Rust being a systems language means it is used to build systems. Pretty straightforward, right? 
      <br><br>
      Rust is soon (as of writing) going to be a part of the Linux Kernel which was for a long time written only in C. Rust, of course, was developed by at Mozilla Research and used 
      for writing the Mozilla browser engine. In essence, one can think of Rust as C/C++ but better and more importantly modern. Much of the design ideas behind developing 
      Rust was to make sure it tackled the most common problems of C/C++ including, but not limited to, memory handling safety and very strict type-checking with different data-types 
      within int and float with different bit sizes to be equivalent the byte, short, int, long, float and double.
      <br><br>
      Rust also comes with its own package manager and build system - <em>Cargo</em>. This makes it more modern in the vein of npm or pip, although the usage and the exact manner of package download
      and incorporation is more npm's <em>package.json</em> and less <em>pip install</em>. 
        
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      If you haven't already, please install Rust. I reccomend using the rustup tool avialable in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust-lang.org</a>. Once that is done, 
      decide on a name for your project. This will be the command you are going to call to do your work for you. I have chosen <em>"grit</em> i.e., git with an r (r, for Rust of course). 
      <br><br>
      Type the following in a terminal
      <code>cargo init grit</code>
