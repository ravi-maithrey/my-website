        Making life easier with Rust: Pushing to GitHub via a single command
    </h1>
    I use git for almost all my code projects, including this website. And like almost all who use git, I also use github.
    And as I finish any work I choose to do on a given day, I find myself facing the task of adding, commiting and pushing my code into my 
    remote repository. Before we go on any further, I am indeed aware that these are just three simple
    commands on the terminal. A single line even, if one were to make judicious use of '&' to put all these commands together in the same line.
    <br>
    <br>
    But the problem with it lies in it's simplicity. Since we assume it is just a single line, we are not averse to typing it out again and again
     as we assume no time wil be wasted by it. And yet the time spent typing these out adds up.
