            Making life easier with Rust: Pushing to GitHub via a single command
        </h1>
        I use git for almost all my code projects, including this website. And like almost all who use git, I also use
        github.
        And as I finish any work I choose to do on a given day, I find myself facing the task of adding, commiting and
        pushing my code into my
        remote repository. Before we go on any further, I am indeed aware that these are just three simple
        commands on the terminal. A single line even, if one were to make judicious use of '&' to put all these commands
        together in the same line.
        <br>
        <br>
        But the problem with it lies in it's simplicity. Since we assume it is just a single line, we are not averse to
        typing it out again and again
        as we assume no time wil be wasted by it. And yet the time spent typing these out adds up. That is not to
        mention how mind-numbing it would be to
        type out these commands over and over again for every change we make. What I am trying to get at is, these are
        the sort of tasks we ought to automate
        as much as possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        Having established that we will be writing a program to automate this simple, yet repetitive task, we need to
        decide which programming language we are going to use.
        I have chosen to write my program in Rust. I did this because at the time I was writing this I was interested in
        Rust and was learning the language on my own.
        So, this seemed like a fun little project for me to get a better grasp on the subject. I'll give a very brief
        introduction (in my terms) of Rust before we proceed to the actual code.
        At the end, we would have an executable binary which we can run on the command line with a single word to
        perform
        the different tasks of adding, commiting and pushing.
        Feel free to skip that if you already know what Rust is.

        <h3>Rust</h3>
        According to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust-lang.org</a>, Rust is "A language empowering everyone
        to build reliable and efficient software." According to Wikipedia, Rust is "Rust is a multi-paradigm,
        high-level, general-purpose programming language designed
        for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency." None of these definitions made sense to me when I
        first started learning Rust.
        <br><br> The trick to getting what Rust actually lies in the fact that it is a systems language. Now, I forget
        where I first saw this term but it is widely used and certainly not an obscure descriptor.
        Anyway, Rust being a systems language means it is used to build systems. Pretty straightforward, right?
        <br><br>
        Rust is soon (as of writing) going to be a part of the Linux Kernel which was for a long time written only in C.
        Rust, of course, was developed by at Mozilla Research and used
        for writing the Mozilla browser engine. In essence, one can think of Rust as C/C++ but better and more
        importantly modern. Much of the design ideas behind developing
        Rust was to make sure it tackled the most common problems of C/C++ including, but not limited to, memory
        handling safety and very strict type-checking with different data-types
        within int and float with different bit sizes to be equivalent the byte, short, int, long, float and double.
        <br><br>
        Rust also comes with its own package manager and build system - <em>Cargo</em>. This makes it more modern in the
        vein of npm or pip, although the usage and the exact manner of package download
        and incorporation is more npm's <em>package.json</em> and less <em>pip install</em>.

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        If you haven't already, please install Rust. I reccomend using the rustup tool avialable in <a
            href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust-lang.org</a>. Once that is done,
        decide on a name for your project. This will be the command you are going to call to do your work for you. I
        have chosen <em>"grist"</em> i.e., git with an r and an s(rs, for Rust of course).
        <br><br>
        Type the following in a terminal
        <br><br>
        <pre>
      <code>cargo init grist</code></pre>

        Of course, grist is the name we have chosen for this package. You can choose whatever you wish.

        This will create a new folder named grist within the present working directory. Navigate into the folder. That
        should have a subfolder named <code>src</code>
        Within that subfolder, is a file <code>main.rs</code>. It is this file we will be modifying. It should have some
        placeholder code by default,
        to print <code>hello world.</code>. We'll be modifying as shown below.
        <br>
        <pre>
          <code>
            use clap::Clap;
            use std::process::Command;
            
            #[derive(Clap)]
            #[clap(version = "1.2", author = "Ravi Maithrey <maitrey.ind@gmail.com>")]
            struct Opts {
                // The message to be passed in while commiting to git
                /// The message to be passed in while commiting to git
                #[clap(short, long, default_value = "from my pc")]
                message: String,
            }
            fn main() {
                let option = Opts::parse();
                let message = option.message;
                let mut child = Command::new("/usr/bin/sh");
                // let command = "git add . && git commit -S -m '" + message + "' && git push";
                let command = format!("git add . && git commit -S -m '{}' && git push", message);
                child
                    .args(&["-c", &command]) // set up stdin so we can write on it
                    .status()
                    .expect("Could not run the command"); // finally run the command
            }            
          </code>
      </pre>

        Let us go through this line by line to make sure we understand what is going on.
        <br>
        <pre><code>
        use clap::Clap;
        use std::process::Command;
      </code></pre>
        These two lines allow us to import the libraries we need. The <code>std</code> library is present by default
        when rust
        is installed and we use the submodule process and subsubmodule Command to start a process and run a command
        within it. But the library <code>Clap</code>
        needs to be downloaded and installed first before we can import it.
        To add it to our current project, we run the following in our terminal.
        <pre><code>
          cargo add clap.
      </code></pre>
        <br>
        <code>Clap</code> is a library which allows us to easily parse command line arguments. You can find more
        information about
        the library by going through it's <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.3/clap/">documentation</a>. Here we will
        cover what is needed for our purposes.
        <br>

        The first thing to do is to create the <code>Opts</code> struct for <code>Clap</code>. Before we do that, you
        can see that we used the <code>derive</code>
        attribute before defining the struct. This attribute allows for new items to be automatically generated for data
        structures whenever we use them later
        in the program. Since we <code>derive(Clap)</code> this struct would be autmatically assigned data in the same
        format as defined by <code>Clap</code>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Below that, we define the actual struct, which has to named 'Opts' for <code>Clap</code> to recognize it. Each
        line of this struct should start
        with a description of what the corresponding command-line argument would be.
        For our purposes we only need one command-line argument, which is the commit message. We specify that the
        argument can be specified as a 'short' form,
        i.e., <code>-m</code> and a long form which is <code>--message</code> and also specify a default value if people
        choose to ignore it. Then we give a name to the variable
        which stores our message. This variable's name is the one used in the command line argument to take inputs as
        specified above.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once our struct is defined, we write the main function. First we parse the arguments from the command line and
        pass them to the struct using
        <code>Opts::parse()</code>. Then, we extract the message stored in the <code>message</code> variable. After
        this, we first start a child process
        to execute our commands, initializing it with the hashbang.
        <br>
        <br>
        Do note that this is <code>bash</code> script and thus will work only in shells which support <code>bash</code>.
        We then create our command as a
        formatted string and add our command to the child process we created eariler. We also pass an argument
        <code>-c</code> to make sure that it is executed.
        To allow this command to be run, we call the <code>expect()</code> function on it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Building and Running</h3>
        To build this file for testing, simply run
        <pre>
           <code>cargo build</code>
       </pre>
        To build it with all the optimizations, use
        <pre>
           <code>
               cargo build --release
           </code>
       </pre>
        The optimized binary would be found in the target/release subfolder. A good recommendation would be to copy it
        over to <code>/usr/local/bin</code> so that it
        is avialable on the command-line wherever you might want to run it at.

        <h3>Closing Comments</h3>
        This is a very simple project, but it is one which has already saved me a lot of time especially because I made
        it a habit of mine to have verson control
        on every project early and regularly. Little automation here and there saves a lot of cumulative effort and I'd
        urge all those who are reading this to try
        out such automation in their own lives.
