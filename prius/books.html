                <h4>When We Ceased to Understand the World - BenjamÃ­n Labatut</h4>
            </li>
            <a href="articles/wwctutw.html">My in-depth review. </a>I consider this a must-read book for many reasons,
            chief of which are the material tackled in this book and the high quality of the prose. An exploration into
            diverse inventions and discoveries and the people involved in this process, this book is both history and
            historical fiction.

                <h4>Twilight of the Idols, or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer - Friedrich Nietzsche</h4>
            </li>
            One of the first books by Nietzsche that I read from beginning to end. It starts off as a series
            of aphorisms, then talks about what Nietzsche sees as the problem with post-Scoratic (read: Platonic)
            greek philosophy. This nicely leads into a discussion about how basing our entire being on pure reason
            is not necessarily a good thing. (I am not fully stating the extent of Nietzsche's argument so one can
            read it for themself) The main aim of the book is asking the reader to make sure thier idols are not
            hollow and to philosphically hit out idols with (philosophical) hammers to make sure they are solid.

                <h4>Cultish; The Language of Fanaticism - Amanda Montell</h4>
            </li>
            Talks about the languages cults use to "brainwash" people. Chock-full of personal anecdotes, practical
            advice and technical studies, this book is best read in two frames of mind - one, the true crime type
            where you learn about cults and their methods and two, as an instruction manual learning about how
            cults draw in people so you can stay safe from those same methods.
